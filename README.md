# ADL Recogition using Wrist Placed Accelerometers

#### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Accelerometer Data readings from the dataset are analyzed. 
Spectral Analysis is first performed to get a general idea of the data.
Noise Removal is performed using Filters.
Machine Learning is used to create a model to differntiate between activites and confusion matrix is generated for futher analysis.

Mini Project.pdf can be viewed for further project description and results

#### **FILE DESCRIPTION**

The Datasets are available in folder titled Activity Data
 
1) Discrete_Time_Filter.m - Returns a discrete-time filter object.

2) DisplayTrial.m plots the acceleration recorded in the given accelerometer trial for Climbing Stairs

4) DisplayModel.m plots the acceleration recorded in the modelling trials stored in the given folder.

3) Mini_Project.ipynb performs the ML to create the model

#### **RUN INSTRUCTIONS**

All code files can be run on MATLAB

.ipynb file has to be run using jupyter notebooks
